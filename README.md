# Pokemon API Server
This is a simple JSON API server that serves pokemon info.

## Example URL's
### initial list of all pokemon:
https://api.omga.be/pokemon/pokelist

### in depth stats of a single pokemon, by it's ID
https://api.omga.be/pokemon/pokemon/1

---

routes are hard-coded to be run from a directory in the root.


the "q" script is being used so that I can query the csv files with mysql commands.
it can be found here:
http://harelba.github.io/q/

Also, I did not write the .csv files.  I forgot where I found them, but I will update this readme when I figure it out.
